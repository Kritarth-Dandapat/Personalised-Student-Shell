### Features to Implement in the Custom Shell

#### 1. **Basic Shell Features**
- **Command Execution**:
  - Execute standard UNIX/Linux commands using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
  - Example commands: `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Print meaningful error messages if commands fail.

#### 2. **Built-In Commands**
- **`cd`**:
  - Change the current working directory using `chdir()`.
  - Handle errors if the directory does not exist.
- **`help`**:
  - Display a list of available commands and their usage.
- **`exit`**:
  - Terminate the shell.

#### 3. **Command History**
- Maintain a list of previously executed commands.
- Add a `history` command to display the list.
- Implement shortcuts like `!!` to repeat the last command.

#### 4. **Command Aliases**
- Allow users to define custom shortcuts for commands (e.g., `alias ll='ls -la'`).
- Store aliases in a dictionary and use them during command execution.

#### 5. **Auto-Completion**
- Implement Tab-based auto-completion for commands and file paths.
- Use libraries like `readline` or create a custom solution.

#### 6. **Scripting Support**
- Enable the shell to execute scripts with commands written in a text file.
- Example: `./script.sh` should execute the commands in `script.sh`.

#### 7. **Custom Prompt**
- Allow users to customize the shell prompt.
- Support placeholders like `username@hostname:path$`.

#### 8. **Syntax Highlighting**
- Use ANSI escape codes to color-code the shell prompt and error messages.

#### 9. **Programming Help**
- Add a `learn` command to display tutorials or tips about common shell commands.
- Provide offline documentation or integrate with online resources.

#### 10. **File Search**
- Create a built-in `search` command to find files and directories recursively.
- Support basic patterns and wildcards.

#### 11. **Task Automation**
- Add scripts for tasks like renaming files, organizing directories, or setting up projects.
- Example: `organize` command to group files by type.

#### 12. **Multi-User Support**
- Allow multiple users to use the shell with personalized settings.
- Save configurations for each user in a separate file.

#### 13. **Additional Features**
- **Reminders**: Implement a `remind` command to set reminders based on system time.
- **Command Suggestions**: If a command is not found, suggest alternatives (e.g., "Did you mean `cd`?").
- **Run Programs by Type**: Detect file types and execute them accordingly (e.g., compile `.c` files, interpret `.py` files).

#### Implementation Order
1. Start with basic command execution (`fork`, `execvp`).
2. Add built-in commands (`cd`, `help`, `exit`).
3. Implement history and aliases.
4. Add auto-completion and scripting support.
5. Work on advanced features (reminders, search, task automation).

#### Tips
- Use modular programming: separate functionality into distinct functions.
- Test each feature thoroughly before adding new ones.
- Document each feature and its usage in the README file.
